# Cloud Incident Response Kit

This project is a Cloud-native digital forensics pipeline and analysis kit. My involvement included architecting and implementing a 
framework for launching idempotent and complex Kubernetes clusters into the AWS commercial and GovClouds. The deployment of this kit 
assumes minimal knowledge on the user sideand focuses on automation and alleviating configuration complexity. 

The project's main priorities focus on increasing tool reliability, improving workflow integration and task automation, and streamlining 
analytic collaboration. This project has refined my understanding of how the modern cloudis shaped as well as the tools that power it. 
I have been introduced to cutting edge technologies like cilium, eBPF, microVMs, container internals, streaming databases, and message 
brokers. I’ve had the opportunity to greatly affect how the project grew and was able to help foster relationships across work units 
to ensure the project's persistence into the future. In doing so, I’ve been blessed with a good team of brilliant people who share a common 
goal with me, and even more so that I got to mentor and shape some of the newer engineers.
