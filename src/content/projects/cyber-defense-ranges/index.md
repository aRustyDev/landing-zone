# Cyber Defense Ranges

This refers to a few self-similar projects that I have spearheaded development on for my unit in the Air Force. The general template includes a meet with the strategic community 
partner in question, where we define their needs and specifications. Once the high level details are understood, we usually move ontosome infrastructure definition and begin setting 
up access control frameworks. Our common toolsets include Terraform, Packer, Ansible, javascript, and Proxmox.
