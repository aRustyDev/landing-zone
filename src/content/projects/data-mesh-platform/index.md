# Data Mesh Platform

This project is currently in the early stages, only barely into the alpha stages, but is set to become an organization-wide platform 
for ingesting arbitrary data types and generating normalized data sets that are stored and replicated across multiple database types, such 
as graphs, vectors, NoSQL, Documents, indices, as well as relational databases. Our goal is to be able to transform and correlate different 
artifacts into intermediary data structures that we can use to enrich the data that we do our analysis on. This will empowerour analysts to 
more efficiently handle the rapidly growing datasets they arerequired to sift through on engagements.
